status: complete
outcome: SUCCEEDED

goal: Completed Phase 1 - Environment & Connectivity for Polymarket market-making bot
now: Ready to initialize GitHub repo and proceed to Phase 2 - Market Discovery & Data Fetching
test: source venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/test_phase1.py -v

done_this_session:
  - task: Created project structure with src/ and tests/ directories
    files: [src/__init__.py, tests/__init__.py]
  - task: Implemented configuration management with environment variable loading
    files: [src/config.py, .env.example]
  - task: Built Polymarket CLOB API client wrapper with singleton pattern
    files: [src/client.py]
  - task: Created logging utilities
    files: [src/utils.py]
  - task: Wrote comprehensive Phase 1 verification tests (all 6 passing)
    files: [tests/test_phase1.py]
  - task: Set up project documentation and dependencies
    files: [README.md, requirements.txt, .gitignore]

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - singleton_pattern: Used singleton pattern for ClobClient to reuse connection and avoid multiple instantiations
  - read_only_mode: Phase 1 uses read-only client (no authentication) to verify connectivity before wallet setup in Phase 4
  - test_driven: All phases are test-driven - must pass verification tests before moving to next phase
  - incremental_phases: Building in 10 phases to ensure each component is verified working before adding complexity

findings:
  - polymarket_api: Polymarket CLOB API is accessible via py-clob-client library without authentication for read operations
  - connectivity_verified: Successfully tested get_ok() and get_server_time() endpoints
  - test_coverage: All 6 Phase 1 tests passing (config, client creation, connectivity, server time, singleton, logging)

worked:
  - py-clob-client library for Polymarket API access
  - python-dotenv for environment configuration
  - pytest for test verification
  - Singleton pattern for client instantiation

failed: []

next:
  - Initialize git repository
  - Create GitHub repository
  - Push code to GitHub with comprehensive README
  - Plan Phase 2 - Market Discovery & Data Fetching
  - Implement market listing and filtering functionality
  - Add orderbook fetching capabilities
