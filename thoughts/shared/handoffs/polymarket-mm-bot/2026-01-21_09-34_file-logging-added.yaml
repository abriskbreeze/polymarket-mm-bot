goal: Added persistent file logging for overnight bot runs
now: Run bot overnight and analyze logs in morning
test: source venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/ -v --timeout=60

done_this_session:
  - task: Added RotatingFileHandler to logging setup
    files: [src/utils.py]
  - task: Verified file logging works (logs/bot.log created)
    files: [logs/bot.log]

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - rotation_config: 10MB max file size with 5 backups (50MB total) - balances history retention vs disk usage
  - log_location: logs/ directory at project root - already in .gitignore

findings:
  - original_logging: Bot only logged to console (StreamHandler), no persistence
  - overnight_logs_lost: User lost overnight run logs because terminal scroll buffer was cleared

worked:
  - RotatingFileHandler from logging.handlers - standard library, no dependencies
  - Path(__file__).parent.parent / "logs" for relative path resolution

failed:
  - N/A - straightforward implementation

next:
  - Run bot overnight with file logging enabled
  - Analyze logs/bot.log in morning for trade activity
  - Consider adding trade-specific log file for easier analysis
