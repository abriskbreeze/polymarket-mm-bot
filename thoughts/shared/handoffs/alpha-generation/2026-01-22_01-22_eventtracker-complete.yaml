goal: Complete Phase 1 alpha integration - all 3 modules fully operational
now: Monitor alpha signals in live trading and tune thresholds

test: source venv/bin/activate && (echo -e "\n7\n1\n" | timeout 15 python run_mm.py --manual 2>&1) | grep -E "(Event tracker|Trades poller|ARB)"

done_this_session:
  - task: Fixed trades poller startup bug (was only in REST fallback path)
    files: [src/feed/feed.py]
  - task: Completed EventTracker integration with market resolution time
    files: [src/strategy/market_maker.py, src/strategy/runner.py, src/tui/runner.py, run_tui.py]
  - task: Added datetime import and market_end_date parameter to SmartMarketMaker
    files: [src/strategy/market_maker.py]
  - task: Parse end_date from market object and pass through runners
    files: [src/strategy/runner.py, run_tui.py]
  - task: Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub
    files: []

blockers: []

questions:
  - What spread/size multipliers should EventTracker use near resolution?
  - What flow imbalance thresholds work best in production?

decisions:
  - trades_poller_both_paths: Start trades poller in both WebSocket success AND REST fallback paths, since early return at line 135 was skipping it
  - market_end_date_parsing: Parse ISO format (2026-02-01T20:00:00Z) using fromisoformat with Z replacement for UTC

findings:
  - trades_poller_bug: The startup code was only in REST fallback branch; WebSocket success returned early at line 135
  - event_tracker_needs_timestamp: EventTracker.set_market_metadata() expects resolution_time as Unix timestamp
  - alpha_modules_verified: All 3 modules logging correctly - ARB scans, trades poller starts, event tracker configured

worked:
  - Debug logging to diagnose trades poller startup failure
  - Systematic verification with grep patterns on bot output
  - Adding datetime.timestamp() for resolution_time conversion

failed: []

next:
  - Monitor flow signals during active market hours
  - Tune alpha thresholds based on real market behavior
  - Consider adding more detailed alpha signal logging
