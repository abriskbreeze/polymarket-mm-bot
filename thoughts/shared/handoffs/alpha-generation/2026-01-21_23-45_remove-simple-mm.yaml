goal: Removed SimpleMarketMaker class, keeping only SmartMarketMaker as default
now: Push changes to GitHub and verify bot runs correctly

test: source venv/bin/activate && python -c "from src.strategy.market_maker import SmartMarketMaker; print('✓ Import OK')"

done_this_session:
  - task: Removed SimpleMarketMaker class and run_market_maker() factory from market_maker.py
    files: [src/strategy/market_maker.py]
  - task: Updated runner.py to remove --simple flag and always use SmartMarketMaker
    files: [src/strategy/runner.py]
  - task: Updated TUI runner to always use SmartMarketMaker, removed use_smart_mm parameter
    files: [src/tui/runner.py]
  - task: Removed --simple flag from run_tui.py CLI
    files: [run_tui.py]
  - task: Deleted test_phase7.py (only tested SimpleMarketMaker)
    files: [tests/test_phase7.py]
  - task: Updated documentation to reflect SmartMarketMaker only
    files: [README.md, src/tui/state.py]

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - single_mm_implementation: Removed SimpleMarketMaker to reduce maintenance burden. SmartMarketMaker is now the only option, with sensible defaults that work for all use cases.
  - delete_phase7_tests: Deleted test_phase7.py entirely since it only tested SimpleMarketMaker. SmartMarketMaker has integration test coverage via alpha module tests.

findings:
  - total_removal: Removed approximately 600 lines of code (SimpleMarketMaker class, tests, CLI flags, conditional logic)
  - no_regressions: All 59 alpha module tests still pass after removal
  - clean_codebase: No SimpleMarketMaker references remain in source code (only in generated repomix-output.xml)

worked:
  - Systematic removal approach: class → imports → CLI flags → tests → docs
  - Verification at each step: syntax checks, import tests, test suite
  - Using tldr diagnostics to confirm no new type errors introduced

failed: []

next:
  - Commit changes with descriptive message
  - Push to GitHub
  - Run live test to verify SmartMarketMaker works correctly
